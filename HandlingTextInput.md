#Handling Text Input
TextInput is a basic component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function
to be called everytime the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is
submitted. 

For example, let's say as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. 
In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" 
would be translated as "üçïüçïüçï".

                    import React, { Component } from 'react';
                    import { AppRegistry, Text, TextInput, View} from 'react-native';
                    
                    class PizzaTranslator extends Component {
                     constructor(props) {
                      super(props);
                      this.state = {text: ''};
                      }
                    
                    render() {
                     return(
                      <View style={{padding: 10}}>
                      <TextInput
                       style={{height: 40}}
                       placeholder="Type here to translate!"
                       onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}
                      />
                      <Text style={{padding: 10, fontsize: 42}}>
                       {this.state.text.split(').map((word) => word && 'üçï').join('')}
                      </Text>
                     </View>
                        );
                      }
                    }
                    
                    AppRegistry.registerComponent('PizzaTranslator', () => PizzaTranslator);
                    
In this example, we store text in the state, because it changes over time.

There are a lot more things you might want to do with the text input. For example, you could validate the text inside
while the user types. 

Text input is probably the simplest example of a component whose state changes naturally over time.
