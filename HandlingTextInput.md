#Handling Text Input
TextInput is a basic component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function
to be called everytime the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is
submitted. 

For example, let's say as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. 
In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" 
would be translated as "üçïüçïüçï".

                    import React, { Component } from 'react';
                    import { AppRegistry, Text, TextInput, View} from 'react-native';
                    
                    class PizzaTranslator extends Component {
                     constructor(props) {
                      super(props);
                      this.state = {text: ''};
                      }
                    
                    render() {
